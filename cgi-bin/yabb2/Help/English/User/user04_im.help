### Section 1

$SectionSub1 = "Personal_Messaging";
$SectionBody1 = qq~YaBB is about community and communication. And there are plenty of ways to communicate: Posting on the boards, Personal Messaging, e-Mail, ICQ, AIM, YIM, MSN, SKYPE/VoIP, and Gtalk. Of course, all methods of communication are only available to registered members. An exception is when the Forum Staff decides to allow guests to post on one or more boards. If unregistered members &#40;Guests&#41; are allowed to post, they still cannot view the Member List nor send Personal Messages &#40;See exception below&#41;.<br />
<p><b>Personal Messages</b><br /></p>
<p>While e-Mail is a good way to correspond privately with members, it has several drawbacks: You must open your e-Mail application to write and send the message; the recipient must open his/her e-Mail application; check his/her mail and your message will mixed in with all the other mail and it can take sometimes several minutes to an hour for mail to reach the recipient.</p>
<p>As an alternative to e-Mail, YaBB offers a faster, more private method. Personal Messaging on the forum provides instantaneous delivery to the recipient's private mailbox. The PM is sent and received entirely through YaBB, so neither you nor the recipient have to open another program or leave YaBB. Personal Messaging also gives both the sender and recipient greater privacy: no one's real e-Mail address is involved or revealed. Personal Messages show only the username and name of both parties.</p>
<p>YaBB offers an option for Administrators to allow Guests to send an Alert to the Moderator of a Board if there is a problem. If this is enabled, the Moderators of the Board will receive a PM but will not be able to reply except by sending an e-Mail to the Guest.</p>
<font color="#0099CC"><b><u>USER TIP:</u></b> Allowing Guests to post on your forum or send PMs poses risks, such as spam or worse being posted or sent in PMs. To reduce this risk, we highly recommend the Administrator use the option available in the Security Settings to require a Validation Code for any Guest action &#40;Post, PM, Alert&#41;.<br /></font>
<p>Another option the Administrator can enable is allowing Personal Messages to be sent as copies similar to e-Mails.  If enabled, you can send carbon copies (cc) and blind carbon copies (bcc) and the recpients may also respond directly to other original recipients.</p>
<p>The Admnistrator may also enable the option for members to create additional storage folders for their PMs, and if the number of messages is large, you can find individual messages by using the PM Search feature.</p>
<p>If a recipient isn't online, Personal Messages wait in the member's PM box until the next time he/she logs in and manually reads and/or deletes them. Should you for some reason need to call back the message before the other party reads it, you can recall it by going to your PM Outbox and clicking the Recall link under the message.</p>
<p>YaBB Personal Messages center is basically a self-contained, highly private e-Mail system.</p>

### Section 2
#############################################
$SectionSub2 = "Broadcast_Messaging";
$SectionBody2 = qq~YaBB allows Forum Staff the capability to communicate with each other through the use of <b>Broadcast Messages</b>.<br />
<p>Broadcast Messaging is a optional feature for Administrators to enable if they choose. The Administrator can enable Broadcast Messaging for these groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Administrators</li>
<li>Administrators and Global Moderators</li>
<li>Administrators, Global Moderators, and Moderators</li>
</ul>
<p>Those allowed Broadcast Message permission can send BMs to the following recipients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Administrators</li>
<li>Global Moderators</li>
<li>Moderators and all members of member groups assigned as Moderators</li>
<li>All forum members</li>
<li>Any combination of the above</li>
</ul>
<p>The Admnistrator may also enable the option for Guests to send a <b>PM to the Administrator</b>. These PMs are actually transmitted to the Administrator as a Broadcast Message, so it requires both the PM to Admin option AND Broadcast Messaging allowed for Administrators in order to work.</p>
